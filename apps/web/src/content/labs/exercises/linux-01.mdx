estimatedTime: "10m"
objectives:
  - Use pwd to display the current working directory
  - Navigate directories with cd
  - List files and directories with ls
  - Understand absolute vs relative paths
  - Create directories with mkdir
verificationCriteria:
  - Created directory /home/learner/projects

  - Created file /home/learner/projects/webapp/README.md
hints:
  - "Use mkdir -p to create nested directories in one command"
  - "Use touch to create empty files"
  - "Remember: absolute paths start with /, relative paths don't"

## Introduction

The Linux file system is organized as a hierarchical tree structure, starting from the root directory `/`. Understanding how to navigate this structure is fundamental to working with Linux.

## Key Commands

### `pwd` - Print Working Directory

Shows your current location in the file system:

```bash
$ pwd
/home/learner
```

### `ls` - List Directory Contents

Lists files and directories:

```bash
$ ls           # Basic listing
$ ls -l        # Long format with details
$ ls -la       # Include hidden files (starting with .)
$ ls -lh       # Human-readable file sizes
```

### `cd` - Change Directory

Navigate to different directories:

```bash
$ cd /var/log        # Absolute path (starts with /)
$ cd projects        # Relative path (from current directory)
$ cd ..              # Go up one level
$ cd ~               # Go to home directory
$ cd -               # Go to previous directory
```

### `mkdir` - Make Directory

Create new directories:

```bash
$ mkdir myproject              # Create single directory
$ mkdir -p parent/child/grand  # Create nested directories
```

## File System Structure

```
/                    # Root directory
├── home/            # User home directories
│   └── learner/     # Your home directory
├── etc/             # System configuration files
├── var/             # Variable data (logs, etc.)
├── usr/             # User programs
└── tmp/             # Temporary files
```

## Your Task

Create a project structure for a web application:

1. Navigate to your home directory
2. Create a `projects` directory
3. Inside `projects`, create a `webapp` directory
4. Create a `README.md` file inside `webapp`

Your final structure should look like:

```
/home/learner/
└── projects/
    └── webapp/
        └── README.md
```
