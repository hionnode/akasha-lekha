difficulty: beginner
estimatedTime: "15m"
objectives:
  - View running processes with ps and top
  - Understand process states and priorities
  - Send signals to processes
  - Run processes in the background
  - Use job control commands
verificationCriteria:
  - Background process running with name "sleep"
  - Process has been started by the learner user
  - Process is running in the background (not foreground)
hints:
  - "Use & at the end of a command to run it in the background"
  - "Use jobs to see background jobs"
  - "Use ps aux to see all processes"

## Introduction

In Linux, a **process** is a running instance of a program. Understanding how to view and manage processes is essential for system administration and troubleshooting.

## Viewing Processes

### `ps` - Process Status

```bash
$ ps                 # Show processes in current terminal
$ ps aux             # Show all processes (BSD style)
$ ps -ef             # Show all processes (System V style)
$ ps aux | grep nginx  # Filter for specific process
```

**Common columns:**
- `PID` - Process ID (unique identifier)
- `USER` - Process owner
- `%CPU` - CPU usage percentage
- `%MEM` - Memory usage percentage
- `STAT` - Process state
- `COMMAND` - Command that started the process

### `top` / `htop` - Interactive Process Viewer

```bash
$ top                # Real-time process viewer
$ htop               # Enhanced version (if installed)
```

Press `q` to exit, `k` to kill a process, `h` for help.

### `pgrep` - Find Process by Name

```bash
$ pgrep nginx        # Get PID of nginx process
$ pgrep -l nginx     # Include process name
```

## Process States

| State | Code | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Running | R | Currently executing or ready to run |
| Sleeping | S | Waiting for an event |
| Stopped | T | Stopped (e.g., Ctrl+Z) |
| Zombie | Z | Terminated but not cleaned up |

## Signals

Signals are used to communicate with processes:

```bash
$ kill PID           # Send SIGTERM (graceful shutdown)
$ kill -9 PID        # Send SIGKILL (force kill)
$ kill -STOP PID     # Pause process
$ kill -CONT PID     # Resume process
$ killall nginx      # Kill all processes by name
```

## Background & Foreground

### Running in Background

```bash
$ sleep 100 &        # Start in background
$ jobs               # List background jobs
$ fg %1              # Bring job 1 to foreground
$ bg %1              # Resume job 1 in background
```

### Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+C

- `Ctrl+C` - Terminate foreground process (SIGINT)
- `Ctrl+Z` - Suspend foreground process (SIGTSTP)

## Your Task

1. Start a long-running process in the background
2. Verify it's running with `ps`
3. Check its job number with `jobs`

Run this command to start the background process:

```bash
sleep 300 &
```

Then verify it's running.
