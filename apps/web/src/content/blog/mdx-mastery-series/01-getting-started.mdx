**Part {frontmatter.seriesPart} of the MDX Mastery Series**

Welcome to the first part of our MDX Mastery series! In this post, we'll cover the fundamentals of MDX and how to get started using it in your Astro blog.

:::info
This is part 1 of a 4-part series. Make sure to check out the other parts for advanced topics and specialized components!
:::

## What is MDX?

MDX stands for **Markdown + JSX**. It's a format that allows you to write JSX (React components) directly in your markdown files. This gives you the best of both worlds:

- **Markdown simplicity** - Write content quickly with familiar markdown syntax
- **Component power** - Embed interactive React/Astro components when needed

## Why Use MDX?

MDX enables you to:

1. **Create interactive content** - Embed buttons, forms, and other interactive elements
2. **Reuse components** - Use your existing Astro components in blog posts
3. **Dynamic content** - Use JSX expressions for calculations and conditional rendering
4. **Better organization** - Keep content and components together

## Installation

MDX support in Astro is provided by the `@astrojs/mdx` integration. If you're following this series, it should already be installed, but here's how to add it:

```bash
pnpm add @astrojs/mdx
```

## Basic Setup

Once installed, add MDX to your `astro.config.mjs`:

```javascript title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [mdx()],
  // ... rest of your config
});
```

:::tip
The MDX integration automatically inherits your markdown configuration, including all your remark and rehype plugins!
:::

## Your First MDX File

Create a new file with the `.mdx` extension:

```
src/content/blog/2025-01-16-my-first-mdx.mdx
```

### Basic Structure

```mdx
---
title: "My First MDX Post"
date: "2025-01-16"
excerpt: "Learning MDX basics"
tags: ["mdx", "tutorial"]
featured: false
draft: false
---

# My First MDX Post

This is standard markdown that works exactly as expected!
```

### Adding Your First Component

To use components, import them at the top (after frontmatter):

```mdx
---
title: "My First MDX Post"
date: "2025-01-16"
excerpt: "Learning MDX basics"
tags: ["mdx", "tutorial"]
featured: false
draft: false
---

import Button from '../../components/shared/Button.astro';

# My First MDX Post

Here's a button component:

<Button href="/blog" variant="primary">Back to Blog</Button>
```

## JSX Expressions

MDX supports JSX expressions for dynamic content:

```mdx
---
title: "Dynamic Post"
date: "2025-01-16"
---

# {frontmatter.title}

Published on {new Date(frontmatter.date).toLocaleDateString()}
```

**Common JSX patterns:**

- Access frontmatter: `{frontmatter.title}`
- Format dates: `{new Date(frontmatter.date).toLocaleDateString()}`
- Conditional rendering: `{condition && <Component />}`
- Calculations: `{Math.ceil(wordCount / 200)}`

## Available Components

Your Astro project likely has several components you can use:

- `<Button>` - Navigation buttons
- `<Badge>` - Status indicators
- `<TagPill>` - Tag displays
- Any component from `src/components/`

:::note
Check your project's component directory to see what's available!

## Combining Markdown and Components

One of MDX's strengths is mixing markdown with components:

```mdx
## Introduction

This is standard markdown content.

<Button href="/blog">Explore More</Button>

:::tip
You can use markdown directives too!
:::
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, you're ready to:

1. Create your first MDX blog post
2. Import and use components
3. Use JSX expressions for dynamic content
