You create an AWS account, generate root access keys, and share them on Slack so your cofounder can deploy. You are moving fast. Three months later, you wake up to a $47,000 bill. Cryptominers have been running on your account for weeks. CloudTrail was not enabled, so you cannot even see how they got in.

This happens constantly. Not because founders are careless, but because AWS security documentation assumes you have a compliance team and six months to implement controls. You have 18 months of runway and a product to ship.

**Time:** About 60 minutes.

**Outcome:** A locked-down AWS account with MFA on root, an IAM admin user, CloudTrail logging, billing alerts at $10/$50/$100, and the first file of your agent governance system.

---

## Why This Matters

AWS operates on a **shared responsibility model**. They secure the physical data centers, the hypervisors, the network fabric. You secure your account, your data, and your configurations. Every misconfiguration is your problem.

</Alert>

By the end of this post, your account will be protected against:

- **Credential theft:** root keys floating around in Slack, `.env` files, or GitHub commits
- **Bill shock:** waking up to charges you did not expect
- **Invisible breaches:** attackers operating without any audit trail
- **Single point of failure:** one compromised password giving total access

---

## Root Account Lockdown

When you create an AWS account, you get a single identity: the **root user**. This account has unlimited privileges. It can bypass every IAM policy, delete CloudTrail logs, close the entire account, and do anything to any resource with no restrictions.

There is no way to limit root's power. That is by design. It is the break-glass account for emergencies. But that same unlimited power makes it the single most dangerous credential in your infrastructure.

The goal: use root once to set up your account, then never touch it again.

### Delete Root Access Keys

Root access keys are long-lived credentials that grant unlimited API access. If they exist, delete them now.

<GuideStep title="Delete Root Access Keys" syncKey="part-01-root-keys-deleted">

1. Sign in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) as root
2. Click your account name (top-right corner) and select **Security credentials**
3. In the **Access keys** section, check if any keys exist
4. If keys exist, click **Actions** then **Delete**

</GuideStep>

:::caution
If something is actively using these keys, you have a bigger problem. Stop, find where they are used, and plan a migration to IAM credentials before deleting. We cover proper credential management in [Part 3](/blog/aws-for-startups/03-local-aws-setup).
:::

### Enable MFA on Root

MFA adds a second authentication factor. Even if someone steals your password, they cannot sign in without physical access to your MFA device.

| Type | Security | Convenience | Recommendation |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Passkey (FIDO2) | Highest | High | Best for most founders |
| Authenticator app | High | High | Good alternative |
| Hardware TOTP token | Highest | Low | Enterprise security teams |

<GuideStep title="Enable MFA on Root" syncKey="part-01-root-mfa">

1. From the **Security credentials** page (still signed in as root)
2. In the **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** section, click **Assign MFA device**
3. Choose your MFA type (passkey or authenticator app)
4. Follow the prompts to complete setup
5. **Save your recovery codes somewhere safe** (password manager, not a text file)

</GuideStep>

:::warning
If you lose access to your MFA device and do not have recovery codes, you will go through AWS support to regain access. This process takes days. Save the recovery codes now.
:::

### When You Actually Need Root

After setup, these are the only tasks that require root access:

- Close or rename your AWS account
- Change the root email address
- Activate IAM access to Billing (one-time, we do this below)
- Restore IAM permissions if completely locked out
- Change your AWS Support plan

Full list: [Tasks requiring root credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/root-user-tasks.html)

For everything else, use an IAM admin user.

---

## Your First IAM Admin User

MFA protects against password theft, but it does not reduce root's power. A mistake made while signed in as root (deleting the wrong resource, misconfiguring a policy) has no safety net.

An IAM admin user has the same practical capabilities for daily work, with critical differences:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  ROOT USER                        │
│  Unlimited Power · No Guardrails · Emergency Only │
│  MFA Enabled · Locked Away · Never Used Daily     │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                       │ Creates
                       ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               IAM ADMIN USER                      │
│  Full Practical Access · Actions Logged           │
│  Revocable · Restrictable · Daily Operations      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every action your IAM admin takes is logged in CloudTrail with a specific user identity. You can revoke access without losing account control. You can add restrictions later.

### Create the Admin Group and User

Create a group first, then add your user to it. This pattern scales when you hire.

<GuideStep title="Create Admin Group" syncKey="part-01-admin-group">

1. Sign in to the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/) as root
2. In the left navigation, click **User groups**
3. Click **Create group**
4. Group name: `Administrators`
5. Search for and select the **AdministratorAccess** policy
6. Click **Create group**

</GuideStep>

<GuideStep title="Create Your Admin User" syncKey="part-01-admin-user">

1. In the IAM console, click **Users** then **Create user**
2. Username: `yourname-admin` (use your actual name, not a generic "admin")
3. Select **Provide user access to the AWS Management Console**
4. Choose **I want to create an IAM user** (we cover IAM Identity Center in [Part 2](/blog/aws-for-startups/02-iam-intro-for-starters))
5. Set a strong password, uncheck **Users must create a new password at next sign-in**
6. Click **Next**, select the **Administrators** group, click **Next**, then **Create user**

</GuideStep>

<GuideStep title="Enable MFA on Your Admin User" syncKey="part-01-admin-mfa">

1. In the IAM console, click **Users**, then click your new username
2. Select the **Security credentials** tab
3. In the **Multi-factor authentication** section, click **Assign MFA device**
4. Follow the prompts (same process as root MFA)

</GuideStep>

<GuideStep title="Switch to Your Admin User" syncKey="part-01-switch-admin">

1. Sign out of root
2. Go to `https://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`
3. Sign in with your new IAM admin credentials

**Bookmark this URL.** You will use it every day.

</GuideStep>

<GuideStep title="Set an Account Alias" syncKey="part-01-account-alias">

1. In the IAM dashboard, find **AWS Account** on the right side
2. Next to **Account Alias**, click **Create**
3. Enter something memorable (e.g., `shipfast-prod`)
4. Click **Save changes**

Your new sign-in URL: `https://shipfast-prod.signin.aws.amazon.com/console`

</GuideStep>

## CloudTrail: Your Audit Log

CloudTrail records every API call made in your AWS account. Every console click, every CLI command, every SDK call. When something goes wrong (a resource gets deleted, a security group opens to the internet, costs spike), CloudTrail is how you figure out what happened.

Without it, you are flying blind. With it, you have a forensic record of:

- **Who** made the change (which IAM user or role)
- **What** they changed (which API call, which resource)
- **When** it happened (timestamp)
- **Where** they were (source IP address)
- **How** they authenticated (console, CLI, SDK)

Management events (resource creation, deletion, configuration changes) are free to log. There is no reason not to enable this.

:::tip
CloudTrail does not log S3 object-level access or Lambda invocations by default. Those are data events and cost extra. Management events are enough for now.
:::

<GuideStep title="Create a CloudTrail Trail" syncKey="part-01-cloudtrail">

1. Go to the [CloudTrail console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)
2. Click **Create trail**
3. Trail name: `management-events`
4. Storage location: **Create new S3 bucket** (let AWS generate the name)
5. Log file SSE-KMS encryption: **Enabled** (use AWS managed key)
6. Under Additional settings, enable **Log file validation** (detects log tampering)
7. Click **Next**
8. Keep **Management events** selected, API activity: **Read** and **Write**
9. Click **Next**, then **Create trail**

</GuideStep>

Your account is now recording everything. If something goes wrong six months from now, you will be able to trace exactly what happened.

## Billing Alerts: No Surprise Bills

AWS bills are post-paid. You find out what you owe after you have already spent it. Without alerts, a misconfiguration or attack can run up thousands of dollars before you notice.

### Activate IAM Billing Access

By default, only root can view billing. Fix this now so your IAM admin can manage budgets.

<GuideStep title="Activate IAM Billing Access" syncKey="part-01-billing-access">

1. Sign in as **root** (last time for a while)
2. Click your account name, then **Account**
3. Scroll to **IAM user and role access to Billing information**
4. Click **Edit**, select **Activate IAM Access**, click **Update**

</GuideStep>

### Create Budget Alerts

<GuideStep title="Create Budget Alerts" syncKey="part-01-budget-alerts">

1. Sign in as your IAM admin
2. Go to **Billing and Cost Management**, then **Budgets**
3. Click **Create budget**
4. Select **Customize (advanced)**, choose **Cost budget**, click **Next**
5. Name: `Monthly spend alert`, Period: **Monthly**, Amount: **$50** (adjust to your expected spend)
6. Add three alert thresholds:

| Threshold | Amount | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| 20% | $10 | Early warning, verify everything is expected |
| 100% | $50 | Investigate any unexpected usage |
| 200% | $100 | Something is wrong, check immediately |

7. Add your email for each threshold
8. Click **Next**, then **Create budget**

</GuideStep>

:::warning
AWS Budgets notify you. They do not stop spending. If you need hard spending limits, AWS Organizations with Service Control Policies can help. We cover that in [Part 2](/blog/aws-for-startups/02-iam-intro-for-starters).
:::

### Free Tier Gotchas

AWS Free Tier is generous but has sharp edges:

| Service | Free Tier Limit | Common Gotcha |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| EC2 | 750 hrs/month t2.micro | Two instances doubles the hours |
| RDS | 750 hrs/month db.t3.micro | Multi-AZ doubles the hours |
| S3 | 5 GB storage | Logs accumulate fast |
| Data Transfer | 100 GB/month outbound | Images and video add up |
| NAT Gateway | Not free | $0.045/hr = $32/month |

<GuideStep title="Enable Free Tier Alerts" syncKey="part-01-free-tier-alerts">

1. Go to **Billing and Cost Management**, then **Billing preferences**
2. Select **Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts**
3. Enter your email address
4. Click **Save preferences**

</GuideStep>

### Enable Cost Anomaly Detection

AWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses machine learning to flag unusual spending patterns. It is free.

<GuideStep title="Enable Cost Anomaly Detection" syncKey="part-01-cost-anomaly">

1. Go to **Billing and Cost Management**, then **Cost Anomaly Detection**
2. Click **Create monitor**
3. Select **AWS services** as the monitor type
4. Add your email for alert notifications
5. Set minimum threshold to **$5** (to avoid noise from trivial fluctuations)
6. Click **Create monitor**

</GuideStep>

## Tagging Strategy

Tags are key-value labels on AWS resources. They seem optional until you have 200 resources and cannot tell which project they belong to, whether they are safe to delete, or who created them.

Start with four required tags on every resource:

| Tag Key | Example Values | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| `Environment` | `production`, `staging`, `dev` | Know what is safe to delete |
| `Project` | `website`, `api`, `data-pipeline` | Track costs per project |
| `Owner` | `yourname`, `platform-team` | Know who to ask about a resource |
| `ManagedBy` | `terraform`, `manual`, `agent` | Distinguish human-created from agent-created resources |

The `ManagedBy` tag becomes critical when you start using AI coding agents. When an agent provisions a resource, tagging it `ManagedBy=agent` creates an audit trail you will rely on heavily.

:::note
**Coming in [Part 4](/blog/aws-for-startups/04-terraform-fundamentals):** We enforce required tags with Terraform so untagged resources are rejected before they are created.
:::

## Region Selection

AWS has 30+ regions worldwide. Pick one primary region and stick with it.

**Recommendation for learning: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia).** It gets new features first, has the most documentation, and is generally the cheapest. The latency difference for development work is irrelevant.

For production, answer two questions before deploying:

1. **Where are your users?** If 80% are in India, `ap-south-1` (Mumbai) serves them better than Virginia.
2. **What does compliance require?** GDPR may require EU data residency. Check before you deploy, not after.

**Test your latency to AWS regions:**

<AwsRegionLatency />

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| User latency | Deploy where your users are |
| Compliance | GDPR, HIPAA, and local laws may dictate regions |
| Service availability | Not all services exist in all regions |
| Pricing | Can vary 10-20% between regions |
| Feature releases | `us-east-1` gets features first |

## Create Your AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md

This is the first file of a system that will grow across all 70 parts of this series.

`AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md` is a living document that tells AI coding agents how to work with your infrastructure. It starts with a single line. By Part 62, it will contain 96 lines of rules covering IAM, Terraform, networking, security, Docker, Lambda, and agent governance.

It will be the most important file in your repository.

Create it now in your project root:

```markdown title="AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md"
# Agent Instructions for AWS Infrastructure
```

One line. That is all for now. Every time we establish a rule, a convention, or a boundary in this series, we add it here. The agents you work with will read this file before generating infrastructure code.

This is not busy work. This file is the difference between an agent that generates plausible-looking infrastructure and an agent that generates infrastructure matching your specific constraints. We prove that difference with data starting in [Part 4](/blog/aws-for-startups/04-terraform-fundamentals).

---

<Alert type="warning" title="The Fine Line">

| | |
|---|---|
| ❌ **Under** | Using root daily, no MFA, no billing alerts, no audit trail |
| ✅ **Right** | Root locked with MFA, IAM admin for daily work, CloudTrail logging, billing alerts at $10/$50/$100, tagging strategy documented, AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md started |
| ❌ **Over** | AWS Organizations with SCPs, dedicated security OU, SSO federation, and a 40-page IAM policy document for a solo founder |
| 🤖 **Agent Trap** | Agent creates IAM user with `AdministratorAccess` and no MFA "to avoid permission errors." We address this directly in [Part 2](/blog/aws-for-startups/02-iam-intro-for-starters). |

</Alert>

## What's Coming

Next in **[Part 2: IAM, The Key to Everything](/blog/aws-for-startups/02-iam-intro-for-starters)**, we set up IAM properly: users, groups, roles, policies, and a dedicated agent execution role with scoped permissions. The `AdministratorAccess` policy your admin user has today is temporary.

:::note
**Coming in [Part 3](/blog/aws-for-startups/03-local-aws-setup):** You install your coding agents and give them their first AWS task. The AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md file you just created becomes their operating manual.

## Key Takeaways

1. The root account is for emergencies only: lock it with MFA, delete access keys, and never use it for daily work.
2. CloudTrail is free for management events and there is no reason not to enable it from day one.
3. Billing alerts at $10, $50, and $100 catch problems before they become disasters.
4. Your AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md starts as a single line today; by Part 62, it will be 96 lines of accumulated rules and the most important file in your repository.
