Your Bun API runs on an EC2 instance. SSH in, `git pull`, `bun run start`. The instance reboots at 3 AM because AWS needed to patch the underlying hardware. Your API is down until you wake up and restart it. No auto-restart, no health checks, no scaling. You are the orchestrator, and you just slept through a page.

**Time:** About 60 minutes.

**Outcome:** Your Bun.js API running on ECS Fargate with a task definition, service configuration, ALB integration, auto-scaling, deployment circuit breaker, and structured logging to CloudWatch. Zero servers to manage, automatic restarts on failure, and scaling that responds to load.

---

## Why This Matters

You have three compute options on AWS. Each trades control for operational overhead.

<ComparisonTable>
  <ComparisonHeader columns={["EC2", "ECS Fargate", "Lambda"]} />
  <ComparisonRow feature="Startup time" EC2="Minutes" ECS_Fargate="30-60 seconds" Lambda="Cold start: 100-500ms" />
  <ComparisonRow feature="Max runtime" EC2="Unlimited" ECS_Fargate="Unlimited" Lambda="15 minutes" />
  <ComparisonRow feature="Scaling speed" EC2="Minutes (ASG)" ECS_Fargate="30-90 seconds" Lambda="Instant (Best)" />
  <ComparisonRow feature="Min cost/month" EC2="~$3.80 (t3.nano)" ECS_Fargate="~$9.40 (0.25 vCPU)" Lambda="Free tier" />
  <ComparisonRow feature="Server management" EC2="You manage everything" ECS_Fargate="AWS manages servers" Lambda="AWS manages everything" />
  <ComparisonRow feature="Best for" EC2="Legacy apps, GPUs, custom OS" ECS_Fargate="Long-running APIs (Best)" Lambda="Event-driven, short tasks" />
</ComparisonTable>

ECS Fargate is the sweet spot for a startup running APIs:

- **No servers.** No AMI updates, no SSH, no "the instance ran out of disk space." AWS manages the underlying infrastructure.
- **Container control.** Unlike Lambda, you control the runtime, the process, the port, the health check. You run the same Docker image locally and in production.
- **Right-sized scaling.** Unlike EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (which you set up in [Part 33](/blog/aws-for-startups/33-auto-scaling-groups)), Fargate scales at the task level. You don't provision a whole server for one container.

The tradeoff: Fargate costs roughly 2.5x more per vCPU-hour than an equivalent EC2 instance. For a startup, the operational time savings dwarf the compute cost difference.

## What We're Building

- ECS cluster for your application
- Task definition for the Bun API container
- ECS service with desired count, deployment configuration, and circuit breaker
- ALB integration with target group and health checks
- Auto-scaling policies based on CPU utilization
- CloudWatch log group for structured container logging

---

## ECS Concepts

Before writing Terraform, understand the hierarchy:

```
ECS Cluster
  └── Service (manages desired task count)
        └── Task (runs one or more containers)
              └── Container (your Docker image)
```

- **Cluster:** A logical grouping. With Fargate, the cluster is just a namespace. No EC2 instances to manage.
- **Task Definition:** A blueprint that describes which container to run, how much CPU and memory to allocate, which ports to expose, and where to send logs.
- **Service:** Maintains a desired number of running tasks. If a task dies, the service launches a replacement. The service also handles deployments: rolling out new task definitions without downtime.
- **Task:** A running instance of a task definition. In Fargate, each task gets its own ENI (Elastic Network Interface), its own IP, and its own isolated compute.

## Terraform: ECS Cluster

```hcl title="infra/modules/ecs/cluster.tf"
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}"

  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-cluster"
  })
}

resource "aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers" "fargate" {
  cluster_name = aws_ecs_cluster.main.name

  capacity_providers = ["FARGATE", "FARGATE_SPOT"]

  default_capacity_provider_strategy {
    capacity_provider = "FARGATE"
    weight            = 1
    base              = 1
  }
}
```

`containerInsights` enables CloudWatch Container Insights, which gives you CPU, memory, and network metrics per task without any code changes. The cost is $0.01 per metric per month, negligible for the visibility it provides.

`FARGATE_SPOT` is available for fault-tolerant workloads at 70% discount. For now, we use standard Fargate. You can shift non-critical services to FARGATE_SPOT later.

## Terraform: Task Definition

```hcl title="infra/modules/ecs/task-definition.tf"
resource "aws_ecs_task_definition" "bun_api" {
  family                   = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-bun-api"
  requires_compatibilities = ["FARGATE"]
  network_mode             = "awsvpc"
  cpu                      = 256
  memory                   = 512
  execution_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.ecs_execution.arn
  task_role_arn            = aws_iam_role.ecs_task.arn

  container_definitions = jsonencode([
    {
      name      = "bun-api"
      image     = "${var.ecr_repository_url}:${var.image_tag}"
      essential = true

      portMappings = [
        {
          containerPort = 3000
          protocol      = "tcp"
        }
      ]

      environment = [
        { name = "NODE_ENV", value = "production" },
        { name = "PORT", value = "3000" },
        { name = "LOG_LEVEL", value = "info" }
      ]

      secrets = [
        {
          name      = "DATABASE_URL"
          valueFrom = var.database_url_secret_arn
        }
      ]

      healthCheck = {
        command     = ["CMD-SHELL", "bun --eval \"fetch('http://localhost:3000/health').then(r => r.ok ? process.exit(0) : process.exit(1)).catch(() => process.exit(1))\""]
        interval    = 30
        timeout     = 5
        retries     = 3
        startPeriod = 15
      }

      logConfiguration = {
        logDriver = "awslogs"
        options = {
          "awslogs-group"         = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.bun_api.name
          "awslogs-region"        = var.region
          "awslogs-stream-prefix" = "bun-api"
        }
      }
    }
  ])

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name    = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-bun-api"
    Service = "bun-api"
  })
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "bun_api" {
  name              = "/ecs/${var.project}-${var.environment}/bun-api"
  retention_in_days = 30

  tags = var.common_tags
}
```

Critical settings explained:

- **`cpu = 256` (0.25 vCPU), `memory = 512` (0.5 GB).** This is the smallest Fargate task size. It handles a Bun API serving hundreds of requests per second. Start here. Scale up only when metrics tell you to.
- **`secrets` block.** Database credentials come from Secrets Manager (set up in [Part 37](/blog/aws-for-startups/37-secrets-manager)), not environment variables. ECS injects them at task startup.
- **`healthCheck`.** The container-level health check, separate from the ALB health check. ECS uses this to determine if a task is healthy.
- **`retention_in_days = 30`.** Logs older than 30 days get deleted. Without this, CloudWatch Logs grow forever.

<Alert type="caution" title="Agent Trap">

Agents allocate 2 vCPU and 4 GB memory as the default Fargate task size because that is a common example in documentation. For a Bun API handling typical startup traffic (10-100 requests per second), 0.25 vCPU and 0.5 GB is sufficient. The agent's default costs 8x more per task, and at 3 tasks minimum, that is $75/month versus $9.40/month for the same workload.

**What catches it:** Always check the `cpu` and `memory` values in task definitions during review. The AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md cost constraints make this a required review item.

</Alert>

## IAM Roles

ECS needs two IAM roles:

1. **Execution role:** Used by the ECS agent to pull images from ECR, send logs to CloudWatch, and retrieve secrets. This is infrastructure-level access.
2. **Task role:** Used by your application code inside the container. This is application-level access (S3, DynamoDB, SQS, etc.).

```hcl title="infra/modules/ecs/iam.tf"
# Execution role: ECS agent uses this
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_execution" {
  name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-ecs-execution"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Service = "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })

  tags = var.common_tags
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ecs_execution" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.ecs_execution.name
  policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "ecs_secrets" {
  name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-ecs-secrets"

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Effect = "Allow"
      Action = [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
      ]
      Resource = var.secret_arns
    }]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "ecs_secrets" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.ecs_execution.name
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.ecs_secrets.arn
}

# Task role: your application code uses this
resource "aws_iam_role" "ecs_task" {
  name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-ecs-task"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [{
      Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
      Effect = "Allow"
      Principal = {
        Service = "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
      }
    }]
  })

  tags = var.common_tags
}
```

The execution role gets `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` (AWS managed) plus a scoped policy for your specific secrets. The task role starts empty. You add permissions as your application needs them: S3 access for uploads, SQS for queues, etc.

---

## Terraform: ECS Service

```hcl title="infra/modules/ecs/service.tf"
resource "aws_ecs_service" "bun_api" {
  name            = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-bun-api"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.bun_api.arn
  desired_count   = 2
  launch_type     = "FARGATE"

  deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 100
  deployment_maximum_percent         = 200

  deployment_circuit_breaker {
    enable   = true
    rollback = true
  }

  network_configuration {
    subnets          = var.private_subnet_ids
    security_groups  = [aws_security_group.ecs_tasks.id]
    assign_public_ip = false
  }

  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.bun_api.arn
    container_name   = "bun-api"
    container_port   = 3000
  }

  depends_on = [aws_lb_listener_rule.bun_api]

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name    = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-bun-api"
    Service = "bun-api"
  })

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [desired_count]
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "ecs_tasks" {
  name_prefix = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-ecs-tasks-"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id

  ingress {
    from_port       = 3000
    to_port         = 3000
    protocol        = "tcp"
    security_groups = [var.alb_security_group_id]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-ecs-tasks"
  })
}
```

Key decisions:

- **`desired_count = 2`.** Two tasks across two AZs. One task can handle the load, but two gives you availability during deployments and AZ failures.
- **`deployment_circuit_breaker` with `rollback = true`.** If a new deployment fails health checks, ECS automatically rolls back to the previous working version. Without this, a bad deployment takes down your service until you manually intervene.
- **`deployment_minimum_healthy_percent = 100`, `deployment_maximum_percent = 200`.** During deployment, ECS starts new tasks before stopping old ones. Zero downtime.
- **`assign_public_ip = false`.** Tasks run in private subnets (set up in [Part 20](/blog/aws-for-startups/20-vpc-fundamentals)). Traffic comes through the ALB.
- **`ignore_changes = [desired_count]`.** Auto-scaling adjusts the count. Terraform should not override it.

---

## ALB Integration

The ALB you created in [Part 22](/blog/aws-for-startups/22-alb-load-balancer) routes traffic to your ECS tasks via a target group.

```hcl title="infra/modules/ecs/alb.tf"
resource "aws_lb_target_group" "bun_api" {
  name        = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-bun-api"
  port        = 3000
  protocol    = "HTTP"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id
  target_type = "ip"

  health_check {
    enabled             = true
    path                = "/health"
    port                = "traffic-port"
    protocol            = "HTTP"
    healthy_threshold   = 2
    unhealthy_threshold = 3
    timeout             = 5
    interval            = 30
    matcher             = "200"
  }

  deregistration_delay = 30

  tags = merge(var.common_tags, {
    Name    = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-bun-api-tg"
    Service = "bun-api"
  })
}

resource "aws_lb_listener_rule" "bun_api" {
  listener_arn = var.alb_listener_arn
  priority     = 100

  action {
    type             = "forward"
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.bun_api.arn
  }

  condition {
    path_pattern {
      values = ["/api/v1/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

- **`target_type = "ip"`.** Required for Fargate. Unlike EC2 target groups that register instances, Fargate target groups register IP addresses (one per task ENI).
- **`deregistration_delay = 30`.** When a task is being replaced, the ALB gives it 30 seconds to finish in-flight requests before removing it. Default is 300 seconds, which is too long for a startup API.
- **Path-based routing.** `/api/v1/*` goes to the Bun API. In [Part 42](/blog/aws-for-startups/42-ecs-fargate-python-go), you'll add rules for Python and Go services on different paths.

---

## Auto-Scaling

```hcl title="infra/modules/ecs/autoscaling.tf"
resource "aws_appautoscaling_target" "bun_api" {
  max_capacity       = 10
  min_capacity       = 2
  resource_id        = "service/${aws_ecs_cluster.main.name}/${aws_ecs_service.bun_api.name}"
  scalable_dimension = "ecs:service:DesiredCount"
  service_namespace  = "ecs"
}

resource "aws_appautoscaling_policy" "bun_api_cpu" {
  name               = "${var.project}-${var.environment}-bun-api-cpu"
  policy_type        = "TargetTrackingScaling"
  resource_id        = aws_appautoscaling_target.bun_api.resource_id
  scalable_dimension = aws_appautoscaling_target.bun_api.scalable_dimension
  service_namespace  = aws_appautoscaling_target.bun_api.service_namespace

  target_tracking_scaling_policy_configuration {
    predefined_metric_specification {
      predefined_metric_type = "ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization"
    }
    target_value       = 70.0
    scale_in_cooldown  = 300
    scale_out_cooldown = 60
  }
}
```

- **Min 2, max 10.** Two tasks is the floor for availability. Ten handles significant traffic spikes. Adjust the max based on your traffic patterns after you have real data from [Part 44](/blog/aws-for-startups/44-k6-containers).
- **Target CPU: 70%.** When average CPU across tasks exceeds 70%, ECS adds tasks. Below 70%, it removes them (respecting the minimum).
- **Scale-out cooldown: 60 seconds.** React quickly to load spikes.
- **Scale-in cooldown: 300 seconds.** Wait 5 minutes before removing tasks. Prevents flapping (scaling up and down repeatedly).

---

## Structured Logging

Your Bun API should output structured JSON logs. ECS ships these to CloudWatch Logs via the `awslogs` driver configured in the task definition.

```typescript title="services/bun-api/src/logger.ts"
interface LogEntry {
  level: string;
  message: string;
  timestamp: string;
  service: string;
  traceId?: string;
  requestId?: string;
  [key: string]: unknown;
}

export function log(level: string, message: string, meta: Record<string, unknown> = {}) {
  const entry: LogEntry = {
    level,
    message,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    service: "bun-api",
    ...meta,
  };
  console.log(JSON.stringify(entry));
}

export const logger = {
  info: (msg: string, meta?: Record<string, unknown>) => log("info", msg, meta),
  warn: (msg: string, meta?: Record<string, unknown>) => log("warn", msg, meta),
  error: (msg: string, meta?: Record<string, unknown>) => log("error", msg, meta),
};
```

Structured logs let you query CloudWatch Logs Insights:

```text title="CloudWatch Logs Insights query"
fields @timestamp, level, message, traceId
| filter level = "error"
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```

Without structured logs, you get unformatted text that is nearly impossible to search at scale.

## The Fine Line

<Alert type="warning" title="The Fine Line">

| | |
|---|---|
| ❌ **Under** | Running containers on EC2 with `docker run` and manual restarts. No health checks, no auto-scaling, no rolling deployments. You are the orchestrator. |
| ✅ **Right** | ECS Fargate with ALB, auto-scaling (min 2, max 10, target CPU 70%), deployment circuit breaker, structured logging, and 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GB per task. |
| ❌ **Over** | EKS (Kubernetes) for a handful of services. Adds a control plane ($73/month), kubectl complexity, Helm charts, and a learning curve that takes weeks, not hours. |
| 🤖 **Agent Trap** | Agent allocates 2 vCPU / 4 GB memory per task "to be safe." With 2 tasks minimum, that is $150/month instead of $19/month. Always check `cpu` and `memory` in task definitions. Start at the smallest size and scale up with data. |

</Alert>

## What's Coming

Next in **Part 42: ECS Fargate, Python and Go APIs**, we deploy the Python FastAPI and Go services using the same infrastructure pattern. One ALB, path-based routing, three services. The Terraform module you just built is language-agnostic.

## Key Takeaways

1. ECS Fargate eliminates server management while giving you full container control, making it the right default for startup APIs that outgrow Lambda's 15-minute limit.
2. Start every Fargate task at 0.25 vCPU / 0.5 GB and scale up only when CloudWatch metrics justify it, because the agent's "safe" default of 2 vCPU / 4 GB costs 8x more.
3. Deployment circuit breaker with automatic rollback is the single most important ECS service setting: it prevents bad deployments from taking down your production API.
