# Phase 15: Dashboards & Alerts (Parts 60-61)

## Phase Goal

Master OpenTelemetry beyond auto-instrumentation and build production SigNoz dashboards with alerting. Golden Signals monitoring and SLO tracking.

## Thread State

| Thread | Entering | Exiting |
|---|---|---|
| AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md | 83 lines | 83 lines (no additions) |
| Agent Scorecard | 26 panels | 26 panels (no additions) |
| Model Eval Framework | Recalibration 3 done | No changes |
| MCP Integration | observability-mcp | No changes |

## Part Summary

| Part | Title | Key Deliverable | Thread Additions | Est. Words |
|:--:|---|---|---|:--:|
| 60 | OpenTelemetry Mastery | Advanced OTel: manual spans, attributes, baggage, sampling | None | 3,000-3,500 |
| 61 | SigNoz Dashboards & Alerts | Golden Signals dashboards, alerting, SLOs | None | 3,000-3,500 |

## Dependencies

- **Requires:** Phase 14 (observability deep dive, event-driven patterns traced)
- **Unlocks:** Phase 16 (Production Readiness — full observability in place)

## Writer Notes

- Part 60 goes beyond auto-instrumentation. Manual spans, custom attributes, baggage propagation.
- Part 61 brings SigNoz to production-readiness: real dashboards, alerting rules, SLOs.
- These two parts complete the SigNoz surface. The Grafana Scorecard gets its final panels in Part 62.
