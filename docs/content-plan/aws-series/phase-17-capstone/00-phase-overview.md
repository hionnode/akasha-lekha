## Writer Notes

- Capstone applies everything — no new concepts introduced.
- Part 67 is design-heavy. Part 68 is the big deployment. Part 69 is operations. Part 70 is reflection.
- Part 70 should be emotionally resonant — the reader has been on a 70-part journey. The comparison of empty AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md (Part 1) to 96 lines (Part 62) is powerful.
- The full pipeline produces most of the capstone deployment — that's the point.
