## The Fine Line
Not applicable for the graduation part — this is reflection, not implementation.

## Thread Progression
- All threads: Final state, no additions. Complete.
  - AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md: 96 lines
  - Scorecard: 29 panels
  - Eval: Production eval with 4 recalibrations completed
  - MCP: Full governance with audit logging

## Key Takeaways
1. You started with an empty file and blind trust. You end with 96 lines of earned instructions and a Trust Score that tells you exactly how much to trust your agents.
2. The pipeline isn't the destination — it's the ongoing practice. Run it daily, recalibrate quarterly, improve continuously.
3. Trust is a number, not a feeling. Your Scorecard, your eval framework, your MCP governance — they turn gut feelings into measurable data.
4. The most important skill you learned isn't any AWS service. It's knowing when to reach for an agent and when to rely on your own judgment.

## Lead Magnet
- **Name:** Graduation Checklist + Complete AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md Template
- **Format:** PDF + markdown
- **Contents:** Complete AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md with all 96 lines, graduation checklist, "what's next" guide, recommended reading.

## Writer Notes
- This is the emotional capstone. The reader has been on a 70-part journey.
- The AGENT-INSTRUCTIONS.md diff (empty → 96 lines) should be visually powerful.
- The Scorecard growth timeline (0 → 29 panels) should feel like an achievement.
- End with forward momentum — next series tease, consulting offer, community invitation.
- The final line should be memorable. Something about trust, measurement, and the journey.
